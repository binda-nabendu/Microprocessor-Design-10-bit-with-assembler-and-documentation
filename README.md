# Microprocessor-Design-10-bit-with-assembler-and-documentation
Here I will try to design a 10-bit CPU. I want to try some different. For that reason, I did not make any 2 exponent CPU(like 8bit, 16bit,32bit).
To Make this I Use Logisim for Its Implementation and C++ for Implementing its assembler. 
In this project, you also get all the necessary documentation to understand this project.
It will be very good news for me, that It will help you somehow.

So enjoy my project...
Goodluck...
